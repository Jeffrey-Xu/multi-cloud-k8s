# Multi-Cloud Gaming Platform - Comprehensive Plan

## Project Overview
Building a web-based Monopoly Go-like multiplayer game deployed on a multi-cloud Kubernetes platform combining AWS EKS and Azure AKS with Consul service mesh federation.

## Architecture Components

### 1. Cloud Infrastructure (Cloud Architect Role)
- **AWS EKS**: Primary cluster for game services
- **Azure AKS**: Secondary cluster for redundancy and load distribution
- **Consul Service Mesh**: Cross-cloud service discovery and communication
- **Terraform**: Infrastructure as Code for reproducible deployments
- **Load Balancing**: Global load balancer for multi-cloud traffic distribution

### 2. Game Application (Game Developer Role)
- **Frontend**: React-based web client with real-time UI
- **Backend Services**:
  - Game Engine Service (game logic, board state)
  - Matchmaking Service (player pairing, lobby management)
  - User Management Service (authentication, profiles)
  - Leaderboard Service (rankings, statistics)
  - Notification Service (real-time updates)
- **Database**: Multi-region database setup (PostgreSQL + Redis)
- **Real-time Communication**: WebSocket connections for live gameplay

### 3. DevOps Pipeline (DevOps Engineer Role)
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions with multi-cloud deployment
- **Container Registry**: Multi-cloud container distribution
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus + Grafana across clusters
- **Logging**: Centralized logging with ELK stack
- **Security**: Service mesh security policies and secrets management

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Foundation (Week 1-2)
1. **Multi-Cloud Setup**
   - Deploy AWS EKS cluster
   - Deploy Azure AKS cluster
   - Configure Consul federation
   - Set up cross-cloud networking

2. **Basic Services**
   - Deploy ingress controllers
   - Set up monitoring stack
   - Configure service mesh policies

### Phase 2: Core Game Development (Week 3-4)

   - User authentication service
   - Basic game engine
   - Simple matchmaking
   - Database setup

2. **Frontend Development**
   - React game client
   - WebSocket integration
   - Basic game board UI

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Week 5-6)

   - Complete Monopoly mechanics
   - Real-time multiplayer
   - Leaderboard system
   - Game statistics

2. **Production Readiness**
   - Load testing
   - Security hardening
   - Performance optimization

### Phase 4: Operations & Scaling (Week 7-8)
1. **CI/CD Pipeline**
   - Automated deployments
   - Blue-green deployment
   - Rollback mechanisms

2. **Monitoring & Observability**
   - Application metrics
   - Distributed tracing
   - Alerting setup

## Technology Stack

### Infrastructure
- **Kubernetes**: EKS (AWS) + AKS (Azure)
- **Service Mesh**: Consul Connect
- **IaC**: Terraform
- **Networking**: AWS VPC + Azure VNet peering

### Application
- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Socket.io-client
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, Socket.io
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (primary), Redis (cache/sessions)
- **Message Queue**: Redis Pub/Sub

### DevOps
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions
- **Containers**: Docker + Kubernetes
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana, Jaeger
- **Logging**: Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana

```

## Success Metrics
- **Performance**: <100ms response time for game actions
- **Availability**: 99.9% uptime across both clouds
- **Scalability**: Support 1000+ concurrent players
- **Recovery**: <5min failover between clouds

## Risk Mitigation
- **Multi-cloud redundancy** for high availability
- **Automated testing** in CI/CD pipeline
- **Gradual rollout** with feature flags
- **Comprehensive monitoring** for early issue detection

## Next Steps
1. Evaluate current infrastructure state
2. Design game microservices architecture
3. Set up development environment
4. Begin Phase 1 implementation
